<h2 id="installation" >Set up / Installation</h2>

<p> To get the server and client application code working on your machine, <a href="https://insidesherpa.s3.amazonaws.com/vinternships/companyassets/Sj7temL583QAYpHXD/setup_devenv_m1_v6.pdf">follow the setup here</a></p>
<p><b>Note:</b>This is the Python 3 version of the JPM 1 exercise. The Python 2.7 version is in <a href="https://github.com/insidesherpa/JPMC-tech-task-1">this other repo</a></p>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
To start the server, run

	python server3.py

this will create random market called 'test.csv' in your working directory if one does not already exist.

If you encounter an issue with `datautil.parser`, run this command: 

	pip install python-dateutil

If you don't have pip yet, you can install it from: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

To start the example client, run:

	python client3.py

To unit test the example client, run:
	python client_test.py

<h2>How to request from the server using curl</h2>
<!--See also [client.py](https://github.com/texodus/exchange_simulator/blob/master/client.py)-->
Query:

	$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/query?id=1'
	{"id": "1", "top_ask": {"price": 129.18, "size": 70}, "timestamp": "2016-08-06 12:32:11.821574", "top_bid": {"price": 128.79, "size": 61}}
